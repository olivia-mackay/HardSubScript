# HardSubScript
Install ffmpeg and add it to your path before using this script.

Pass your working directory when running, for example:
`./hardSubScript.sh Lucky\ Star`

Assuming your files contain a Japanese audio stream, a subtitle stream, and video, this should take your MKV and produce a hard-encoded AVI.
